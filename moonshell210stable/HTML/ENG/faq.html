Are neither the file extension nor contents different?<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="notskin"><HR>
The skin cannot be applied.<BR>
<BR>
Please confirm whether it is a skin corresponding to each version file.<BR>
The log of [Illigal ID.] is written '/moonshl2/logbuf.txt' when the file of an old skin format is read and it disregards it.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="notdpgplay"><HR>

<BR>
Movie encoder is only for Windows 2000 / XP / Vista.<BR>
Windows 7 is recommended.<BR>
The third party application programs such as BatchDPG and SuperC might move to convert it by not windows.<BR>
I do not answer the question such as third party application.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="notdpgconvert"><HR>
Movie cannot be converted.<BR>
<BR>

Do you reproduce with Windows media player?<BR>

ãƒ»Movie reproduction is slow.<BR>
<BR>
When stopping on the way, the decipherment processing is not in time.<BR>
When the bar on the up-left has reddened, it is severe.<BR>
Please decrease the number of frames by the encode setting or decrease the bit rate.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="notolddpgplay"><HR>
An old movie file cannot be reproduced.<BR>
<BR>
When the voice of the OGG format is contained, it cannot be reproduced.<BR>
When the voice of the RGB15/18/21 format is contained, it cannot be reproduced.<BR>
It is a very old method.<BR>
<BR>
<A NAME="notbootak2"><HR>
Moonshell2 does not start in AceKard2<BR>
<BR>
Please start "/misctools/MoonShell2_AlternativeLoader/moonshl2.nds" after installing MoonShell2 with Setup.exe.<BR>
